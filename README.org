* mutabletest

An extended exploration of mutation schemes derived from [[https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lnostdal/1fbd9b3d2ddc7bff1830638ea88348cc/raw/4b8a41782ee1ee36957e1ef6c37b375ce43d2a11/fast_local_mutation.clj][the original by user
lnostdal]] . I would not consider this authoritative, and inclusive all possible
options, but maybe it provides a decent approximation for the orders of
magnitude differences or lack thereof between read/write access for different
reference types. We also include benchmarks for various unsafe, non-STM schemes.


** Usage

run all the performance tests via ~lein test~, which will print results
to out.  It may take a while.  

Alternately, load up the ~mutabletest.core~ namespace and run individual tests
from the REPL.
